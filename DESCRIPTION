Description: This package will be familiar to fans of beepr.
    The main function of this package is textme(), which sends
    you a text message from R. By adding a textme() to a long-running
    job, you can leave the computer while it's processing, and receive 
    a text message via the instant that your job finishes. This package
    uses Twilio to send text messages, and thus requires a Twilio account.
