# textme

<!-- badges: start -->

The heart of this package is a single function called `textme()` that sends you a text message üì± the instant a long-running job completes ‚åõ‚úîÔ∏è.

Now you can leave the computer while it crunches away. Go get a cofee, hit the gym, or work on other things! You'll be notified exactly when your job completes üéâ.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of textme from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("textme") -->
<!-- ``` -->

**textme** is not currently on CRAN. Install the development version from github:

```r
devtools::install_github("richpauloo/textme")
```

## Example

First, sign up for a free Twilio trial account. 

* Use my [referral link](https://www.twilio.com/referral/rIaK9w), and you and I will both get $10 in free credit if you wish to upgrade (~1,250 messages).  
* Use the [regular sign up](https://www.twilio.com/) (you can always use the referral link later if you want to upgrade your free trial version).  

Next, set up a project and verify your number.  

Then, provide information about your twilio account and the number you want to text. These variables are stored in `"~/.Renviron"` for later use.  

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
library(textme)

# replace the values here with your own
tm_configure(twilio_sid   = "AC1ffb4917879549a0f0720c0214bde131",
             twilio_token = "f5c8904b9af81daf3e8dda09f975c369",
             twilio_phone_number = "1234567890",
             target_phone_number = "0987654321")
```

The above code needs to be run only once. Now, and in future R sessions, simply throw a `textme()` at the end of a long-running job (**textme** comes pre-loaded with a handful of fun messages):  

```{r eval = FALSE}
Sys.sleep(5) # some long-running job
textme()     # text me when it's done!
```

Or, you can supply a custom message with the `message` argument: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
textme(message = "üëπ Back to work! You're not paid to run around and drink ‚òï all day!")
```
